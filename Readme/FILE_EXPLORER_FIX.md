# File Explorer Display Bug Fix

## Problem Description
Files were not showing in the file explorer even though they existed in the database. When trying to create a file with the same name, the system correctly showed "file already exists" error, confirming the files were saved but not displayed.

## Root Cause
The issue was in `frontend/src/hooks/useFileSystem.js` in the `createFile` and `renameFile` functions. The file tree state was being updated incorrectly:

### Before (Buggy Code):
```javascript
const createFile = useCallback(async (fileData) => {
  const newFile = response.file;
  setFiles(prev => [...prev, newFile]);
  setFileTree(prev => {
    const updated = [...prev, newFile];  // ❌ WRONG: Trying to build tree from tree + file
    return buildFileTree(updated);
  });
}, [projectId]);
```

The problem: It was trying to build a tree structure from the previous tree (which is already nested) plus a flat file object. This caused the tree builder to fail silently and return an empty or malformed tree.

### After (Fixed Code):
```javascript
const createFile = useCallback(async (fileData) => {
  const newFile = response.file;
  setFiles(prev => {
    const updatedFiles = [...prev, newFile];  // ✅ CORRECT: Update files array
    setFileTree(buildFileTree(updatedFiles)); // ✅ Build tree from flat files array
    return updatedFiles;
  });
}, [projectId]);
```

## Changes Made

### File: `frontend/src/hooks/useFileSystem.js`

1. **Fixed `createFile` function (lines 38-58)**
   - Changed to update `files` state first
   - Build `fileTree` from the updated flat files array
   - Ensures tree is built from correct data structure

2. **Fixed `renameFile` function (lines 84-106)**
   - Applied same fix pattern
   - Update files array, then rebuild tree from that array
   - Removed `files` from dependency array (was causing stale closure issues)

3. **Auto-load files on mount (lines 31-36)**
   - Already existed but confirmed it's working
   - Files load automatically when projectId changes

## How `buildFileTree` Works

The `buildFileTree` function expects a **flat array** of file objects with `parentId` references:
```javascript
[
  { _id: '1', name: 'src', type: 'folder', parentId: null },
  { _id: '2', name: 'App.jsx', type: 'file', parentId: '1' },
  { _id: '3', name: 'index.js', type: 'file', parentId: '1' }
]
```

It then builds a **nested tree structure**:
```javascript
[
  {
    _id: '1',
    name: 'src',
    type: 'folder',
    children: [
      { _id: '2', name: 'App.jsx', type: 'file', children: [] },
      { _id: '3', name: 'index.js', type: 'file', children: [] }
    ]
  }
]
```

## Testing

After this fix:
1. ✅ Files load correctly when opening a project
2. ✅ Newly created files appear immediately in the explorer
3. ✅ Renamed files update correctly in the tree
4. ✅ Deleted files are removed from the tree
5. ✅ Folder structure is maintained properly

## Prevention

To prevent similar issues:
1. Always update the **flat files array** first
2. Rebuild the **tree structure** from the flat array
3. Never try to merge flat objects into tree structures
4. Keep state updates atomic (update both in same setter)

**Fixed:** October 20, 2025
**Issue:** File explorer showing "No files yet" despite files existing in database
**Solution:** Corrected state update logic in useFileSystem hook
